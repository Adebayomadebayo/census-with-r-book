# Overview

This book is an overview of how practitioners can work with data from the US Census Bureau using the R programming language.  The book will focus on data acquisition and wrangling as well as data analysis and modeling of aggregate and individual-level decennial Census and American Community Survey data.  It is designed to be useful for both beginners and advanced users of both R and Census data.  Beginners will find Part 1 more useful, as it covers the basics of R and the US Census and how to work with them together.  Advanced readers will find Parts 2 and 3 more useful, as these parts cover applications from exploratory mapping and visualization to advanced data modeling.  

The growing popularity of the R programming language for exploratory data analysis and data science has led many practitioners to turn to R to work with Census data.  To date, however, no book exists as a reference manual for how to use Census data in R; as such, resources are scattered across blog posts, webinars, and journal articles.  This proposed book aims to fill this gap as a reference manual for a wide range of use cases for practitioners using Census data in R.  
Additionally, the book will take advantage of cutting-edge developments in both data wrangling and spatial data analysis in R.  The bookâ€™s approach will be oriented around two major R ecosystems.  The first is the tidyverse, a suite of packages authored by Hadley Wickham and colleagues at RStudio that are designed to work together seamlessly in data science projects.  The second is sf, a re-imagination of the spatial ecosystem in R that works very well with the tidyverse.  Book readers will learn to work with US Census data using visualization, spatial analysis, and functional programming tools available in these packages.

# An introduction to the United States Census {#intro}

You can label chapter and section titles using `{#label}` after them, e.g., we can reference Chapter \@ref(intro). If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter \@ref(methods).

Figures and tables with captions will be placed in `figure` and `table` environments, respectively.

In this book, you'll be learning about how to use US Census Bureau data in R.  This chapter provides a brief overview of ...


```r
par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1))
plot(pressure, type = 'b', pch = 19)
```

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="bookdown-demo_files/figure-html/nice-fig-1.png" alt="Here is a nice figure!" width="80%" />
<p class="caption">(\#fig:nice-fig)Here is a nice figure!</p>
</div>

Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the `fig:` prefix, e.g., see Figure \@ref(fig:nice-fig). Similarly, you can reference tables generated from `knitr::kable()`, e.g., see Table \@ref(tab:nice-tab).


```r
knitr::kable(
  head(iris, 20), caption = 'Here is a nice table!',
  booktabs = TRUE
)
```



Table: (\#tab:nice-tab)Here is a nice table!

You can write citations, too. For example, we are using the **bookdown** package [@R-bookdown] in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and **knitr** [@xie2015].

# R, the tidyverse, and tidy tools for Census data

{intro here}

## The __tidyverse__

* General discussion
* Core packages
* Core functionality


## Accessing Census and ACS data with __tidycensus__

The __tidycensus__ package, first released in 2017, replicates some of the functionality of the aforementioned packages but with two distinct goals.  First, tidycensus aims to make Census data available to R users in a tidyverse-friendly format.  Second, R users can obtain feature geometry via __tigris__ pre-joined with tabular Census data in a single tidycensus function call.  As such, tidycensus is designed to streamline the process of Census data access and manipulation for R users who are committed to tidyverse-based workflows.  

To get started with tidycensus, users should load the package along with the __tidyverse__ package and set their Census API key with the `census_api_key()` function.  API keys can be obtained at https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html.  Declaring `install = TRUE` when calling `census_api_key()` will install the key for use in future R sessions, which may be convenient for many users.  


```r
library(tidycensus)
library(tidyverse)
census_api_key("YOUR KEY GOES HERE", install = TRUE)
```

Once an API key is installed, users can obtain decennial Census or ACS data with a single function call.  The function `get_decennial()` is used to access decennial Census data from the 1990, 2000, and 2010 Censuses, and the `get_acs()` function is used to obtain data from the 1-, 3-, and 5-year American Community Survey samples since 2011.  To get data from either of these functions, users must specify a string representing the requested `geography`; a vector of Census variable IDs, represented by `variable`; or optionally a Census table ID, passed to `table`.
