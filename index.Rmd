# Overview

This book is an overview of how practitioners can work with Census data around the world using the R programming language.  The book will focus on data acquisition and wrangling as well as data analysis and modeling of aggregate and individual-level data.  It will include a focus on US decennial Census and American Community Survey data along with a selection of other countries around the world.  It is designed to be useful for both beginners and advanced users of both R and Census data.  Beginners will find Part 1 more useful, as it covers the basics of R and Censuses and how to work with them together.  Advanced readers will find Parts 2 and 3 more useful, as these parts cover applications from exploratory mapping and visualization to advanced data modeling.  

The growing popularity of the R programming language for exploratory data analysis and data science has led many practitioners to turn to R to work with Census data.  To date, however, no book exists as a reference manual for how to use Census data in R; as such, resources are scattered across blog posts, webinars, and journal articles.  This proposed book aims to fill this gap as a reference manual for a wide range of use cases for practitioners using Census data in R.  

Additionally, the book will take advantage of cutting-edge developments in both data wrangling and spatial data analysis in R.  The bookâ€™s approach will be oriented around two major R ecosystems.  The first is the tidyverse, a suite of packages authored by Hadley Wickham and colleagues at RStudio that are designed to work together seamlessly in data science projects.  The second is sf, a re-imagination of the spatial ecosystem in R that works very well with the tidyverse.  Book readers will learn to work with US Census data using visualization, spatial analysis, and functional programming tools available in these packages.
